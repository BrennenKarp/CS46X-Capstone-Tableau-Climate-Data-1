## Setting-Up Your Environment

 In order to use GitHub with Tableau, you first need to separate the worbook from the data it comes packaged with. To do this, you must take the following steps:
- Change your file explorer settings to show file name extensions
- Change the file extension of your packaged workbook from .twbx to .zip
- Extract the folder you have just created, doing this will separate the data and worbook files
- The workbook file inside the new folder will be substantially smaller and can be uploaded to GitHub. Check it and make sure that it still functions properly
- You can now delete the original packaged workbook
